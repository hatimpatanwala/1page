                        Thank you for accessing our Service at http://www.1pageonline.com (the “Website“) or through our App. Please read the following Terms of Use carefully as they govern your use of the Service.

                <br />
                <p> The majority of the material on the Service originates from our users and we have little or no editorial control over the material. We therefore cannot guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, completeness, performance or fitness for any particular purpose of the material available through the Service. We cannot accept responsibility for errors, omissions, or inaccurate material available through the Service, and make no warranty that the Service will be uninterrupted or error free, or that any defects will be corrected.</p>
                <p>   Whilst we take steps to prevent misuse of our systems, we cannot warrant that the Service will be free of viruses or other malicious code and accept no liability for loss or damage caused from the transmission of such code. We recommend that you always use up-to-date firewalls and anti-virus software to protect your equipment and data. </p>
                <p>
                    The ratings and other information found on the Service are provided by users, not by us. We do not endorse or recommend any particular third-party service. Any material you obtain from the Service is used at your own risk, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with access or use of the Service (except to the extent that such liability cannot be excluded by law).

                <br />
                <p>
                    It is not possible for us to review all websites which are linked from the Service (or link to the Service), and you should therefore take care when following any link. We cannot accept liability for any loss or damage that may be suffered as a result of following any links.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Service contains discussion forums, bulletin board services, chat areas, communities and/or other message or communication facilities (collectively “Communities”). Although our hope is that all users will use the Service responsibly, and we require all users to ensure that all content that they post on the Service is lawful, we are not responsible for reviewing or policing user content and so it is possible that Communities may carry offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate material, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. We urge you to exercise proper judgement and to use caution and common sense when using Communities. We do not control the information delivered to the Communities, and have no obligation to monitor the Communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for your own communications and for any consequences arising out of them. The Communities are intended to allow users to send and receive messages and material that are legal, proper and related to the particular Community, and you agree that you shall use them only for this purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any communications posted in the Communities or endorse any opinions expressed in the Communities. You should take all due care in relying on material Posted in the Communities, as this is done at your own risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important for you to note that all Communities are public, and that others may read communications made via the Community without the author’s knowledge. Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself in any Community, and do not give personally identifying information about any other person unless entitled to do so.
